# erisa
Erisa is a Discord bot framework built upon [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) using TypeScript.

This is currently a heavy work-in-progress and nothing is guarenteed to be consistent and stable until v1.

## TODO
- Try to overwrite `.emit` so people can do globbed/regex events. (e.g. global logging)
- Built in optional stuff, like logger and command system.
